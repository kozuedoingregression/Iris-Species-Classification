# Iris Classification API Testing with `unittest`

This repository contains a suite of unit tests for an Iris classification API built using Flask. The tests are implemented using Python's `unittest` framework. The API predicts the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on user-provided measurements.
